{:toc}

Stop wasting your time on learning complex deploy systems like GitOps and K8s.

Deploy must be easy.

### 1. Zip

Pack your services configuration to zip file, using zip/python/any library

### 2. Push

Upload your files to server using sftp/scp/ftp/any way

### 3. Unzip

Connect to server by ssh and just unzip services

### 4. Run

Run your services using simple bash script.

I recommend using `docker compose` or other tools that can restart after reboot and deploy multiple services using just one file
